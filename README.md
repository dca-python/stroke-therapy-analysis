This is an analysis of real-world stroke therapy data that I performed for a physiotherapy researcher. The aim of this analysis was to provide insights into the effect of patients' attention on stroke therapy outcomes.
It involved extensive data cleaning as well as feature engineering (see Python scripts), advanced visualization techniques (see Jupyter notebooks), and statistical inference via logistic regression.
More details to follow.
